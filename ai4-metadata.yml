  This module helps users that want to train a deep learning visual identification algorithm (Yolov8) with citizen science data.
  It was developed with the intent to clean and train automatically on Deep Sea Spy data (citizen science project).
  
  The cleaning is done in 2 steps: 
  - converting the bounding boxes in a regular format (optional). In Deep Sea Spy, they come in 3 different formats (points, lines and polygons).
  - unify bounding boxes, using the redundancy of the information as a confirmation for the presence of an individual. 
  There also are other data manipulation/visualisation tools provided in this module to help scientists with the data analysis.

  The user can:
  - Clean its own dataset using either the Deepas API, the Notebook.ipynb or the pipeline_txt.py file.
  - Train with its own data from nextcloud (training is automatic in pipeline_txt.py)
  - Use the existing model trained on [Deep Sea Spy data](https://doi.org/10.17882/101899) for inference.

  Further information in the README.me file provided within this repository.

  This module is mainly based on this already [existing module](https://github.com/ai4os-hub/ai4os-yolov8-torch)
